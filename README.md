# Understanding the role of individual units in a deep neural network

Understanding the role of units in a deep neural network is essential for gaining insights into its functioning and optimizing its performance. NetDissect is a powerful tool that allows us to measure and categorize the units within a network, providing a deeper understanding of its behavior.

##  Purpose of NetDissect
NetDissect enables us to isolate and study individual units in deep neural networks, offering valuable insights into their contribution to network performance. Whether it's a generative network like GANs or an image classifier like VGG-16, the behavior of individual units significantly impacts the quality of generated objects and the classification accuracy of the network.
